    <div>
      <h3 class="heading-3">Problem</h3>
      <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">The COVID-19 pandemic is still sweeping our world, and the United
        States still has some of the highest case and death counts of any country in the world. Even with widespread
        access to vaccines, the US has lost over 800,000 lives to the virus. In particular, my home state of Michigan
        saw the third highest death counts of all US states in the early stages of the pandemic.</p>
      <p class="quote">State politicians and public health officials are in the unenviable position of making decisions
        that will affect both lives and livelihoods, for better or worse. </p>
      <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">Because COVID-19 is a global phenomenon, many of the tools quickly
        developed to track its spread are broad in scope. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
        (CDC) has a COVID surveillance website, but because it provides data for all 50 states, it is not well-tailored
        to meet the needs of decision-makers in Michigan.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="overview-double-column overview-double-column-gap">
      <div class="overview-left">
        <h3 class="heading-3 subsection-spacing">Solution</h3>
        <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">We designed MI Start Map, a COVID-19 dashboard that tracks the
          pandemic’s spread across Michigan through key epidemic indicators, as developed by state epidemiologists.
          Users can view live data at state, region, and county level, and track progression through the MI Safe Start
          risk phases at the state, region, and county level.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-3 subsection-spacing">Process</h3>
        <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">The urgent nature of the pandemic gave our project a super-fast
          timetable, which made the research and development process unique. We used an agile development process with
          1-2 day sprints. This led to multiple pivots within the first two weeks of the project, as the requirements
          and scope were iteratively developed alongside the product. Research and design were being run in parallel by
          our UX team, while our development and data integration teams worked on building the back-end systems.</p>

      <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">Our foundational goal for this project was to support two user groups:
        public health and government decision-makers, and the public. From this goal, our first two requirements
        emerged:</p>

    <h3 class="heading-3">Initial Concept</h3>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">The day after signing onto the project, the original 3-member design
      team brainstormed and wireframed our initial design. We worked with our faculty lead to gather requirements from
      Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) authorities and our advising epidemiologists from the
      University of Michigan School of Public Health (UMSPH).</p>

    <h3 class="heading-3 subsection-spacing">Early Research</h3>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">One of our big risks early on was the inability to talk to either of our
      user groups. Government decision-makers and public health officials were already overwhelmed with pandemic
      response. Public users were off the table until our data pipelines were set up correctly (so as not to cause panic
      or confusion with dummy data). Given these constraints, we ran our early interviews and user tests with
      epidemiologists and PhD students from UMSPH. They were already involved with COVID response work, but had not seen
      the interface, making them the best proxies for our government user group.

        target="_blank">You can view our UMSPH interview protocol here.</a>
    </p>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">To help our UX and development teams better understand and empathize
      with our user groups, we created four personas from a synthesis of interview results and secondary research on US
      public health systems.</p>

    </div>
    <h3 class="heading-3 subsection-spacing">Implementation</h3>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">From here, our team worked in parallel streams to experiment with two
      possible implementations for the dashboard: a version in Tableau, (a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) data
      visualization software), and a ground-up web solution.</p>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">Designing in Tableau was intended to be the quickest solution, where we
      traded development time for interface appeal. But the tradeoffs ended up being too costly: we were working with
      significant UI constraints, slow response time, and clunky navigation. And, as a COTS software, Tableau requires
      costly licenses for access, which public health officials (let alone the general public) did not have.</p>

    <div class="overview-double-column text-image-align">
      <p class="body-bold">All these factors taken together convinced the team that Tableau was not a feasible solution.
      </p>
      <div class="standard-flex-column">
        <a href="assets/msm-tableau-png-16-22-34-939@3x.png" data-lightbox="web-vs-tableau"

        <span class="caption">Web Version</span>
      </div>
      <p class="body-bold">So, we focused our efforts on building a web dashboard from the ground up.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="heading-3 subsection-spacing">Validation</h3>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">Since we were unable to run user testing with public users before our
      launch, we ran a series of heuristic evaluations to catch any major usability issues.</p>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">We ran one for each
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mmuo082ctQQVIfYLCd7PVE48TrzlC_dwoeoIoUWAe1s/edit?usp=sharing"

        target="_blank">mobile</a>. Each evaluation was run independently by three researchers; independent findings
      were aggregated into a single sheet of recommendations. The design team reviewed the results of each heuristic
      evaluation with our development team to improve usability pre-launch.
    </p>

    <h3 class="heading-3 subsection-spacing">Release 1</h3>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">On May 26, 2020 Governor Gretchen Whitmer publicly introduced MI Start
      Map to the State of Michigan. Our dashboard project was just <span class="body-bold">36 days old</span>.</p>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">In this short time, our team had faced countless challenges: pivots,
      redesigns, late nights, last-minute scrambles, and high-stakes demos — all powered by caffeine and a healthy dose
      of camaraderie.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-2">Post-Launch</h2>
      <hr>
    </div>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">Though our first release was cause for celebration, we knew our work had
      just begun.</p>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">We began recruiting members of the public for user testing. This was
      especially critical for our UX team, because up until this point, we had only tested the dashboard with users who
      had a high level of education and epidemiology backgrounds. <span class="body-bold">We wanted to find out whether
        our attempts to make the dashboard easily accessible and understandable for the average member of the public
        were successful.</span> We also wanted to learn more about real use cases for the dashboard - who was using it,
      what they used it for, and why.</p>

    <h3 class="heading-3 subsection-spacing">Research</h3>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">We asked the following research questions to better understand how our
      users interact with the dashboard:</p>
    <ul class="body-bold">
      <li>Can users navigate the map interface?</li>
      <li>Can users find, understand, and justify statuses at all levels?</li>
      <li>Can users find raw, calculated, and graphical data in actionable formats?</li>
      <li>Can users meaningfully compare data from one geographical area to another?</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">All interviews were run remotely using our participant’s conferencing
      software of choice. Each session was divided into two parts: a semi-structured interview and a user test. During
      the semi-structured interview, we got to know each participant: their background, their individual experiences
      during the pandemic, and media consumption habits. The interview then informed the user test, where we had
      participants run through a series of tasks that were structured to their use of the dashboard.</p>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">To keep logging consistent across tests, our team used a rainbow
      spreadsheet to track user testing observations and flag notable issues. We also logged task data, such as time,
      success, and satisfaction.

        target="_blank">You can view a sample of our user testing notes and data logs here</a>.
    </p>

    <h5 class="heading-5">Results</h5>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">We ran these sessions with 11 participants from across the state. Some
      of our major takeaways include:</p>
    <ul class="body-bold">
      <li>Significant variation in ability to navigate the dashboard, influenced primarily by age and secondarily by
        education and occupation.</li>
      <li>Users most frequently visit their own region and county in order to assess risk for themselves, their family,
        or desired activities.</li>
      <li>“New Cases” was the most valuable indicator for every user, and was used as the primary metric for risk
        assessment.</li>
      <li>Users often did not see the time slider feature; if they did, most did not know it to afford “sliding.”</li>
      <li>Confusion about “Public Health Capacity” as a category (users typically expected it to pertain to healthcare
        capabilities/capacity).”</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="heading-3 subsection-spacing">Iterative Redesign</h3>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">Because of its emergent requirements, this project underwent numerous
      redesigns and tweaks in a relatively short time. Many of these changes have stemmed from our epidemiology team
      standardizing pandemic progression indicators with MDHHS and the governor’s office. However, I want to focus on
      several significant changes that <span class="body-bold">directly stemmed from our user testing with both user
        groups.</span></p>
    <h4 class="heading-4">Trendlines & Time</h4>

    <div class="overview-double-column text-image-align">
      <p class="body-large paragraph-image-align">Our initial design had quickly glanceable mini-trendlines intended to
        show trends for the most recent two weeks of data. However, we uncovered significant conceptual issues with our
        current implementation of time navigation - especially for the trend lines and their relationship with the date
        slider. When moved, the date slider would show all data as of or up until the chosen date. The trend lines would
        show the past two weeks of data for the chosen date (so if the slider moved back to 5/13, the trend line would
        display 4/29 - 5/13). This became confusing for users who had different expectations of what the trend line
        should display at any given time. We also observed users forgetting that they had moved the date slider, and
        would read trends incorrectly.</p>
      <div class="standard-flex-column">

            class="side-by-side-image" src="assets/msm-trendlinestime-1@3x.png"></a>
        <span class="caption">Before</span>

        <span class="caption">After</span>
      </div>
      <p class="body-large paragraph-image-align">We solved these inconsistencies by incorporating trends directly into
        the raw data graphs. Now, when the date slider is moved, a marker moves along the graph to show current date
        selection. Additionally, the graph is clickable and can be used for time navigation in the event that the date
        slider is overlooked by the user.</p>
    </div>

    <h4 class="heading-4 subsection-spacing">Status Proposal</h4>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">Our vision for MI Start Map was for it to serve as a tool that public
      health officials could use to make informed decisions about lifting/imposing restrictions. While the dashboard
      still supports that vision - it has a different mechanism than we originally planned.</p>

    <div class="overview-double-column text-image-align subsection-spacing">
      <p class="body-large paragraph-image-align">We initially showed the current risk phase (set by an MDHHS official,
        based on data). Beside it, a new phase proposal recommended by a system algorithm was displayed. If current and
        proposed phases were different, health officials would know to investigate the status of the county or region.
        User testing with epidemiologists uncovered concern about status proposals and how they were supported by raw
        data. We also knew displaying them for the public had the potential to cause confusion and disturbance
        surrounding official risk categorizations - but hiding them went against our goal of transparency.</p>

        <span class="caption">After</span>
      </div>
      <p class="body-large paragraph-image-align">We decided to eliminate the status proposal mechanism and in its
        place, we designed our rainbow icon system. The minified rainbow icons show current risk level and overall
        position within the 6-phase system. The current risk levels in features are generated by the system based on
        thresholds set by MDHHS officials. In turn, officials can look at risk levels for each indicator for a given
        region and determine which of the 6 phases to place it in.</p>
    </div>


    <p class="body-medium gray-text body-paragraph-margin"><span class="italic-text">Note:</span> We later moved away
      from the “rainbow” colors, which were also being used by Michigan Department of Labor to show economic recovery
      phases. Government officials asked us to create our own system for epidemiological risk that did not utilize any
      of the “rainbow” colors. I led this effort and came up with a monochromatic color scheme with a letter rating
      system. This color scheme is currently in use on

    <h4 class="heading-4 subsection-spacing">Date Slider</h4>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">The earliest version of the date slider was cluttered and confusing, so
      we simplified it to include a single date and a better description of its function.</p>

    <div class="overview-double-column">
      <div class="standard-flex-column">
        <a href="assets/msm-slider-1@3x.png" data-lightbox="date-slider" data-title="Version 1"><img
            class="side-by-side-image" src="assets/msm-slider-1@3x.png"></a>
        <span class="caption">Version 1</span>
      </div>
      <div class="standard-flex-column">
        <a href="assets/msm-slider-2@3x.png" data-lightbox="date-slider" data-title="Version 2"><img
            class="side-by-side-image strange-slider" src="assets/msm-slider-2@3x.png"></a>
        <span class="caption">Version 2</span>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">The evolution of the date slider’s label was particularly challenging.
      Because the slider simply changes the endpoint for the data, we knew it was important to make sure the label
      specified that it displayed data as of that date, not only for that date.</p>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">We tried labeling the date slider with exactly what it manipulated:
      indicators, trends, and risk determinations. This worked for epidemiologists and public health officials, but
      <span class="body-bold">public users were confused by what this label meant, and were often discouraged from using
        the slider.</span>
    </p>


    <div class="overview-double-column text-image-align subsection-spacing">
      <p class="body-large paragraph-image-align">The simplified label caters more to public users who don’t have a
        background in epidemiology but are familiar with common filters. Our previous versions of labeling onboarded
        public health officials who are now familiar with the date slider.</p>
      <div class="standard-flex-column">
        <a href="assets/msm-slider-3@3x.png" data-lightbox="date-slider" data-title="Version 3"><img
            class="side-by-side-image" src="assets/msm-slider-3@3x.png"></a>
        <span class="caption">Version 3</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="body-medium gray-text body-paragraph-margin"><span class="italic-text">Note:</span> we later moved from a
      date slider to a date picker to further simplify the selection of a date, since the pandemic has gone on for so
      long that selecting a specific date with a slider became nearly impossible. 😭</p>

      <h2 class="heading-2">What I Learned</h2>
      <hr>
    </div>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">Collaborating with other information professionals from different
      backgrounds, all of whom volunteered their time and energy, was a learning experience on its own. Each person on
      our team had unique experiences and skills that they brought to the team. I’ve heard it said that with diversity
      comes conflict, but this team was able to pull together - united by the human experience of living through a
      pandemic - to come out with an important public health tool, in <span class="body-bold">just 36 days.</span> I am
      very proud of what we have accomplished, <span class="body-bold">together.</span></p>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">Another important thing I learned was how to own my discomfort with
      emergent requirements. As a designer/researcher, having at least some established project requirements upfront is
      comfortable and makes the formation of an R&D plan easier. Because it was born out of a desire to help ease the
      burden on our state’s decision-makers, this project had virtually no upfront requirements. This made kickstarting
      the project challenging, but we were able to forge our own way by building off our own skills and design
      principles, our experiences living through a pandemic, and our knowledge of our primary stakeholders in
      government. As we iterated through design solutions, we were proactively gathering information from our
      stakeholders to develop requirements: their goals, their pain points, and tools they wished they had. Getting
      <span class="body-bold">comfortable with ambiguity</span> and being able to pivot upon formation of new
      requirements is now one of the best tools in my professional toolbox, and I’m looking forward to honing this skill
      in the future.
