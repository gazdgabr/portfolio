        <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">The COVID-19 pandemic is still sweeping our world, and the United States still has some of the highest case and death counts of any country in the world. Even with widespread access to vaccines, the US has lost over 800,000 lives to the virus. In particular, my home state of Michigan saw the third highest death counts of all US states in the early stages of the pandemic.</p>
        <p class="quote">State politicians and public health officials are in the unenviable position of making decisions that will affect both lives and livelihoods, for better or worse. </p>
        <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">Because COVID-19 is a global phenomenon, many of the tools quickly developed to track its spread are broad in scope. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a COVID surveillance website, but because it provides data for all 50 states, it is not well-tailored to meet the needs of decision-makers in Michigan.</p>
