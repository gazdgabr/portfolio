        <h3 class="heading-3">Problem</h3>
        <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">The COVID-19 pandemic is still sweeping our world, and the United States still has some of the highest case and death counts of any country in the world. Even with widespread access to vaccines, the US has lost over 800,000 lives to the virus. In particular, my home state of Michigan saw the third highest death counts of all US states in the early stages of the pandemic.</p>
        <p class="quote">State politicians and public health officials are in the unenviable position of making decisions that will affect both lives and livelihoods, for better or worse. </p>
        <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">Because COVID-19 is a global phenomenon, many of the tools quickly developed to track its spread are broad in scope. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a COVID surveillance website, but because it provides data for all 50 states, it is not well-tailored to meet the needs of decision-makers in Michigan.</p>

          <h3 class="heading-3">Solution</h3>
          <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">We designed MI Start Map, a COVID-19 dashboard that tracks the pandemic’s spread across Michigan through key epidemic indicators, as developed by state epidemiologists. Users can view live data at state, region, and county level, and track progression through the MI Safe Start risk phases at the state, region, and county level.</p>
          
          <h3 class="heading-3">Process</h3>
          <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">The urgent nature of the pandemic gave our project a super-fast timetable, which made the research and development process unique. We used an agile development process with 1-2 day sprints. This led to multiple pivots within the first two weeks of the project, as the requirements and scope were iteratively developed alongside the product. Research and design were being run in parallel by our UX team, while our development and data integration teams worked on building the back-end systems.</p>
