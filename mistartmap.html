        <h3 class="heading-3">Problem</h3>
        <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">The COVID-19 pandemic is still sweeping our world, and the United States still has some of the highest case and death counts of any country in the world. Even with widespread access to vaccines, the US has lost over 800,000 lives to the virus. In particular, my home state of Michigan saw the third highest death counts of all US states in the early stages of the pandemic.</p>
        <p class="quote">State politicians and public health officials are in the unenviable position of making decisions that will affect both lives and livelihoods, for better or worse. </p>
        <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">Because COVID-19 is a global phenomenon, many of the tools quickly developed to track its spread are broad in scope. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a COVID surveillance website, but because it provides data for all 50 states, it is not well-tailored to meet the needs of decision-makers in Michigan.</p>

          <h3 class="heading-3">Solution</h3>
          <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">We designed MI Start Map, a COVID-19 dashboard that tracks the pandemic’s spread across Michigan through key epidemic indicators, as developed by state epidemiologists. Users can view live data at state, region, and county level, and track progression through the MI Safe Start risk phases at the state, region, and county level.</p>
          
          <h3 class="heading-3 subsection-spacing">Process</h3>
          <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">The urgent nature of the pandemic gave our project a super-fast timetable, which made the research and development process unique. We used an agile development process with 1-2 day sprints. This led to multiple pivots within the first two weeks of the project, as the requirements and scope were iteratively developed alongside the product. Research and design were being run in parallel by our UX team, while our development and data integration teams worked on building the back-end systems.</p>

        <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">Our foundational goal for this project was to support two user groups: public health and government decision-makers, and the public. From this goal, our first two requirements emerged:</p>

      </div>
        <h3 class="heading-3">Initial Concept</h3>
        <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">The day after signing onto the project, the original 3-member design team brainstormed and wireframed our initial design. We worked with our faculty lead to gather requirements from Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) authorities and our advising epidemiologists from the University of Michigan School of Public Health (UMSPH).</p>

      </div>

      <h3 class="heading-3 subsection-spacing">Early Research</h3>
      <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">One of our big risks early on was the inability to talk to either of our user groups. Government decision-makers and public health officials were already overwhelmed with pandemic response. Public users were off the table until our data pipelines were set up correctly (so as not to cause panic or confusion with dummy data). Given these constraints, we ran our early interviews and user tests with epidemiologists and PhD students from UMSPH. They were already involved with COVID response work, but had not seen the interface, making them the best proxies for our government user group. 
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EqwaZEYoPSvlKVb9siVU3eOSXJAf6EICHMOXmZLXJgo/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">You can view our UMSPH interview protocol here.</a></p>
        <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">To help our UX and development teams better understand and empathize with our user groups, we created four personas from a synthesis of interview results and secondary research on US public health systems.</p>

      </div>
      <h3 class="heading-3 subsection-spacing">Implementation</h3>
      <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">From here, our team worked in parallel streams to experiment with two possible implementations for the dashboard: a version in Tableau, (a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) data visualization software), and a ground-up web solution.</p>  
      <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">Designing in Tableau was intended to be the quickest solution, where we traded development time for interface appeal. But the tradeoffs ended up being too costly: we were working with significant UI constraints, slow response time, and clunky navigation. And, as a COTS software, Tableau requires costly licenses for access, which public health officials (let alone the general public) did not have.</p>
        
      <div class="overview-double-column text-image-align">
        <p class="body-bold">All these factors taken together convinced the team that Tableau was not a feasible solution.</p>
        <div class="standard-flex-column">
        <a href="assets/msm-tableau-png-16-22-34-939@3x.png" data-lightbox="web-vs-tableau" data-title="Tableau Version"><img class="side-by-side-image" src="assets/msm-tableau-png-16-22-34-939@3x.png"></a>

        <span class="caption">Web Version</span>  
        </div>
        <p class="body-bold">So, we focused our efforts on building a web dashboard from the ground up.</p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="heading-3 subsection-spacing">Validation</h3>
      <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">Since we were unable to run user testing with public users before our launch, we ran a series of heuristic evaluations to catch any major usability issues.</p>  
      <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">We ran one for each 
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mmuo082ctQQVIfYLCd7PVE48TrzlC_dwoeoIoUWAe1s/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">web</a>
         and 
         <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10k_22_v6dk1cEFnAoMcPXQQyLpau45IlkstEWuxZCQI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">mobile</a>. Each evaluation was run independently by three researchers; independent findings were aggregated into a single sheet of recommendations.  The design team reviewed the results of each heuristic evaluation with our development team to improve usability pre-launch.</p>
        
      <h3 class="heading-3 subsection-spacing">Release 1</h3>
      <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">On May 26, 2020 Governor Gretchen Whitmer publicly introduced MI Start Map to the State of Michigan. Our dashboard project was just <span class="body-bold">36 days old</span>.</p>  
      <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">In this short time, our team had faced countless challenges: pivots, redesigns, late nights, last-minute scrambles, and high-stakes demos — all powered by caffeine and a healthy dose of camaraderie.</p>
