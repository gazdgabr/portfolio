    <h3 class="heading-3">Problem</h3>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">Catholic Social Services of Washtenaw County (CSSWC) is a non-profit organization that serves Washtenaw County on the basis of the belief that human beings are meant to function as part of a community. Their Blueprint for Aging program supports elderly adults who are aging alone in their homes, either because they have no caregiver, or cannot afford traditional caregiving services (e.g. assisted living, in-home care, etc…).</p>
    <p class="quote">CSSWC projects that, within the next 10 years, the aging population in Washtenaw County will expand beyond the abilities of the current workforce of dedicated caregivers.</p>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">As a result, non-traditional caregivers will increasingly be called upon to support the elderly. Non-traditional caregivers include community members that interact with elderly adults in their professions, such as dentists, hair stylists, or bus drivers. <span class="body-bold">Support resources need to be expanded to help both dedicated and non-traditional caregivers effectively support the elderly adult population of Washtenaw County.</span></p>

        <h3 class="heading-3">Solution</h3>
        <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">My senior design team partnered with Catholic Social Services of Washtenaw County (CSSWC) to design a web version of their widely-distributed paper senior resource directory in order to expand their outreach and increase access to important resources.</p>
        <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">Our goal was to design a system that is searchable, intuitive, and accessible to all community members. </p>

        <h3 class="heading-3 subsection-spacing">Project Goals</h3>
        <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">At the beginning of the project’s life, we developed a triad of goals with our CSSWC stakeholders to determine how they would measure the project’s success. The first would measure the success of our piece of the project. The other two would be measured by CSSWC upon development of the directory to assess the effectiveness of their outreach.</p>

    <h3 class="heading-3">Competitive Analysis</h3>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">To ensure a robust analysis, we identified three competitor types: direct, indirect, and parallel. In total, we examined 7 competitors.</p>

    <div class="triple-column subsection-spacing">
      <div class="r-d-process">
        <h5 class="heading-5">Direct</h5>
        <p class="body-medium">211 United Way</p>

        <p class="body-medium">Aunt Bertha</p>
        <p class="body-medium">USDHHS</p>
      </div>
      <div class="r-d-process">
        <h5 class="heading-5">Parallel</h5>
        <p class="body-medium">Yellowpages</p>
        <p class="body-medium">Yelp</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h4 class="heading-4 subsection-spacing">Results</h4>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">We did find that direct competitors targeted at older adults made important accessibility considerations. Our indirect competitors gave insight on the architecture of large-scale social services directories. When examining our parallel competitors, we paid attention to the architecture of listings returned by searches, and the filters that accompanied listings.</p>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">Some important takeaways:</p>

    <h5 class="heading-5 subsection-spacing">Direct</h5>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">211 represents the only searchable directory in direct competition; thus, seeing the county-specific content they present will help us to understand the type of content we will be presenting, and the current expectations of Washtenaw County residents.</p>

    <h5 class="heading-5 subsection-spacing">Indirect</h5>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">Aunt Bertha is a national social services directory. Observing how the site organizes and presents social services information will influence the way we present senior services information.</p>

    <h5 class="heading-5 subsection-spacing">Parallel</h5>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">Yelp is successful in the business directory space. Observing how Yelp organizes and enables users to filter through search listings will help us to design an intuitive directory that matches the mental model of a directory that Yelp has created for many users.</p>

    <h3 class="heading-3 subsection-spacing">User Interviews</h3>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">We initially categorized users into distinct groups: older adults, caregivers, and non-traditional caregivers. Once we began talking to users, we found out that <span class="body-bold">these labels are not discrete or mutually exclusive.</span> Many individuals assume multiple roles, and have different levels of identity associated with each label. In particular, a majority of older adults we interviewed turned out to be caregivers. We also found that the non-traditional caregiver role, which we generally assumed to be young(er) people, could easily be filled by older adults who are active community members, or who hold jobs that interact closely with other older adults.</p>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">We also initially began asking participants about their role as “caregiver” or, in the case of older adults, how their “caregiver” was a part of their life. We soon learned that participants we defined as <span class="body-bold">caregivers did not fully realize that they were caregivers, and that older adults often did not recognize the caregivers in their lives as providing “care.”</span></p>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">We took key words and phrases from our user interviews and created an affinity map with seven categories.</p>

    <p class="body-medium">Sam is a synthesis of our family caregivers and young adults who did not identify as caregivers, or were not identified as caregivers by those they care for.

She represents community members that CSSWC wants to reach to communicate the importance of their help in supporting their aging neighbors.</p>

    <h3 class="heading-3 subsection-spacing">Requirements</h3>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">Since the paper directory was primarily used by older adults, our initial assumption was that they would be our target users.</p>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">The results of our user research led to a <span class="body-bold">redefinition of our target audience</span> to include a broad range of users in addition to older adults: caregivers, ranging in age from 20-75, and community members and business owners looking to support older adults/clients. Washtenaw County also has a <span class="body-bold">diversity of geographies:</span> urban areas like Ann Arbor, suburban neighborhoods in Saline, to rural, tight-knit communities like Manchester. These contrasting locations reflected differences in important factors like education, access, age, trust, and community connection.</p>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">Another directional shift that we underwent was the signing of a development firm to build the directory. The development contract did not include a database for the directory, which forced us to rethink any account-bound features.</p>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">Given the key findings from our user interviews, client requirements, and development constraints, we developed the following design requirements:</p>

    <h3 class="heading-3 subsection-spacing">Initial Ideation</h3>
    <p class="body-large body-paragraph-margin">We began by brainstorming ways to recategorize directory. The paper directory, printed on 11x17” (legal) paper, had 31 niche categories of resources. We were able to condense this into 10 categories - as close as we could get to Miller’s Law.</p>
